App - EyeBuddy 

Expanding on the technology of Google Maps, eyeBuddy will navigate you where Google left off, which is at the entrance of the 
building. eyeBuddy is able to navigate users through audio cues, such as "turn left in three steps." The app uses the floor
maps of campus buildings to gather information for its users. The user will be able to activate the app through Siri and tap 
anywhere on the screen to start it up.

We built it using the Google Web Speech API, Bootstrap, Sketch, Xcode

##Who can use the app?

While the app was created for people that are visually impaired, those who might be socially anxious and are uncomfortable with asking for directions can benefit from the app as well. Other applications that are targetted to those visually impaired, don't offer indoor navigation and require volunteer help. eyeBuddy allows you to travel at your own time and with independence.
